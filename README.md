# Scifi Terminals

[VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) is a tool for creating GIFs that can 
be used to demo CLI tools.

But what if we used it to do something different? Like re-create some classic 
scifi movie scenes. Such as [Trinity using NMAP in the Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLVBgsEk5k0) or 
[hacking WOPR in War Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9l5jSDL50)?

## The Tapes

This project has some VHS tapes that generate:

* [Neo receiving messages from Trinity in the Matrix](/gifs/matrix-neo.gif)
* [Trinity hacking using NMAP](/gifs/matrix-trinity-hack.gif)
* [Hacking WOPR in War Games](/gifs/war-games-greetings-professor.gif)
* [WOPR realising Thermonuclear war is a mugs game](/gifs/war-games-strange-game.gif)
* [Dennis Nedry's terminal in Jurassic Park](/gifs/jurassic-park-nedry.gif)
* [Ripley asking about Special Order 937](/gifs/alien-special-order.gif)
* [HALâ€™s farewell message in 2010: The Year We Make Contact](/gifs/2010-hal-message.gif)

There are both [GIF and MP4 versions in the gifs folder](/gifs)

## Theming

I've done some light theming using VHS support for custom fonts and colour themes.

For the colours I've only usually tweaked the background, foreground and cursor colours. 
They're not proper themes.

## The Fonts

I'm not a font geek, but have resorted to googling to try and identify suitable fonts to 
use for the different tapes.

Check the `Set FontFamily` instructions in the `.tape` files to see how they're set.

For the initial hacking scene in War Games, I used [WOPR Tweaked](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1854233/wopr-terminal-1) by [Lord Nightmare](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/59995/lord_nightmare) used under a [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)

For the final scene with WOPR I used [Vector VCR](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1554355/vector-vcr) by [Athalaz](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/1561728/athalax) used under the [Fontstruct Non-Commercial licence](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/license/1554355/vector-vcr)

Otherwise I'm just using my default terminal font, "Monospace Regular".

If you can suggest better alternatives, then let me know.
